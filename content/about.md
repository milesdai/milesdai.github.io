I'm a software engineer at [zeroRISC](https://www.zerorisc.com) working on the [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/) project. My current interests are broadly in building secure systems with a focus on hardware secure elements.

Prior to joining the OpenTitan project, I received an M.Eng degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT, where I worked with Professor [Mengjia Yan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mengjia/).

In my free time, I enjoy working on hobby electronics projects, practicing card magic, and speedcubing. Additionally, I am very passionate about science and engineering education. During my time as an undergraduate, I helped [MIT Club Chem](http://web.mit.edu/clubchem/www/) put on chemistry demonstrations, taught classes such as organic chemistry and introductory electronics to high school students through the [MIT Educational Studies Program (ESP)](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/index.html), and helped run the [MIT Science Olympiad Invitational](https://scioly.mit.edu) each year.
