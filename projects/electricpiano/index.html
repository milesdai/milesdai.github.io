            <h3>April 2018</h3>

            <p>
                MIT hosts an annual event called Campus Preview Weekend (CPW) for admitted students in April. During this event, student groups across campus will put on events to entice the pre-frosh to come to MIT (and maybe even join their group). In my dorm, Next House, I lead a student group called Next Make in which a group of people interested in electrical and mechanical projects come together to work on a project in their spare time. Next Make hosts a "Solder Your Own Circuit Board" event during CPW in which the club members design a PCB and have the pre-frosh come solder components to the board. Afterwards, they can take home a nice little PCB that they put together.

                This year, we decided to make an electric piano with 8 pushbuttons as keys and a 555 timer to generate the tones. In addition, I added a potentiometer to tune the device and a photoresistor to create a pitch-bending, light-theremin effect. When switched on, the pitch bend allows the user to distort the sound by waving their hand over the photoresistor.

            <h2>Circuit</h2>
            <p>
                The circuit was a simple piano circuit that used a stack of resistors in series to create variable resistances that controlled the frequency output by a 555 timer.

            <p>
                I designed the PCB in Eagle and had it manufactured by PCBWay which had a surprisingly good turnaround time. I believe the PCBs arrived under a week from the time I ordered them. The immersion gold contacts on the black soldermask looked fantastic.
