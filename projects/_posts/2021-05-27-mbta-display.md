In this project, we construct a PCB map of the MBTA that shows the real-time positions of all the cars on the subway.

The development of the MBTA Display was sponsored by [MIT ProjX](projx.mit.edu) and was completed with the help of Nathan Huffman.

Note: this project was an imitation of the beautiful [Traintrackr](https://www.traintrackr.io/) project!
I pursued it to learn about IoT, increase familiarity with the ESP32, try out JLCPCB's SMT assembly service, and exercise my PCB design skills.
Even though we made some significant implementation tweaks, I take no credit for the idea.

If you are reading this, I'm really glad you're excited about the project -- unfortunately, I will be deferring the full writeup of this until I have completed my MEng work. Until then, please enjoy some photos of the project!
