The current robot design process is complex and requires intricate manual design and assembly steps. In an effort to facilitate the design and manufacture of customized robots, new approaches rely on modular design and construction techniques. Small, modular "cells" can be composed to create emergent properties across the larger structure. For example, expanding and contracting cells can be assembled to produce a larger structure that walks. Cheney et al. use genetic algorithms to evolve soft robots made up of voxels of various material properties.[^1] See [this video](https://youtu.be/z9ptOeByLA4) showing the evolution of various multicelluar robots that can move quickly using different techniques.

To realize these expanding and contracting cells, we must create structures that allow for volumetric actuation. To this end, we employ auxetic structures. Auxetic structures are structures that have a negative Poisson's ratio; when stretched, these structures expand perpendicular to the direction of applied force as opposed to most materials which become thinner when stretched. Using these types of structures, we can create volumetric expansion from a linear or rotational actuation.

The work I conducted as an undergraduate researcher aimed to create an actuation mechanism for these auxetic structures and a control system for synchronizing a group of these cells.

We used a network of MSP430 microcontrollers from Texas Instruments on the eZ430-RF2500 development board which included the CC2500 2.4-GHz wireless transceiver to control multiple modules from a central access point. We developed a 3D-printed housing to hold the microcontroller, a microservo, and the power circuitry inside the auxetic frame.

The end result was a reproducible module that could be relatively easily manufactured as well as a wireless control system written in Python for easy control over an entire swarm of cells.
