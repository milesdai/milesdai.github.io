This work introduces EngageME: a project that enables automatic monitoring of affect and engagement of children with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) in communication-centered activities. Children with ASC have persistent difficulties with social interactions and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests.

Therapy for children with ASC often includes learning through play, with the children interacting with toys. Recently, social robots have seen increased use in these therapies as children with ASC find them enjoyable and engaging. However, for a robot to engage naturally with a child, it must have some degree of emotional intelligence in order to understand and react to the child's emotions.

EngageME uses deep learning to create novel personalized, culture-tailored models to measure affect and engagement. Using the visual, audio, and physiological input, the model produces predictions about the child's valence (pleasure-displeasure continuum), arousal (alertness), and enagement.

I worked on this project during my freshman fall and throughout sophomore spring as an undergraduate researcher. In particular, I was involved with pre-processing the raw data, developing and implementing the model, and performing model evaluation.
