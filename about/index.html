                I am an undergraduate senior from Carmel, Indiana who is studying electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. I've also got a passion for chemistry and mechanical engineering and enjoy working on projects that give me the opportunity to draw from multiple skillsets to solve interesting problems.

                Some of my hobbies include card magic, running, and biking. In my free time, I also enjoy teaching and science education pursuits. I help MIT Club Chem put on chemistry demonstrations for the community and teach classes such as organic chemistry and introductory electronics to high school students through the MIT Educational Studies Program (ESP). In addition, I help run the MIT Science Olympiad Invitational each year, and I am currently overseeing the development of a makerspace in my dorm building.
