            <h2>Laser Cut Map</h2>
            <h3>December 12, 2019</h3>
            <p>
                My friend and I recently helped out with making a secret santa gift for someone who had indicated an interest in maps. We decided to create a laser engraved map of his hometown -- Seattle. This turned out to be quite fast using an online service called <a href="https://snazzymaps.com/">Snazzy Maps</a>. Using a template on there called Epilog Laser Reverse, we were able to generate a B/W SVG file that we cleaned up in Illustrator before printing onto 1/8" thick clear acrylic. This was put into a picture frame with a black construction paper background for a nice gift.

            <h2>New Workspace</h2>
            <h3>January 31, 2019</h3>
            <p>I recently acquired some nice electronics test equipment, including a bench multimeter, analog oscilloscope, and lab power supply. It seemed like a waste for them to just sit in storage, so I requested a second desk in my room, lofted my bed, and set up this lab bench under my bed.</p> 

            <p>This has been particularly nice because my dorm room is so far from the labs on campus that it's often hard to get access to test equipment when I need it. Also, I found that using public spaces as work benches becomes a problem since I often spend about as much time setting up and cleaning up my projects as I do actually working on them. This setup should solve both problems. So far, it's been working out pretty well, and hopefully, it will get some nice additions soon.</p>

            <h2>Laser Fluorescence</h2>
            <h3>October 19, 2017</h3>
            <p>One of the students in our dorm brought back a piece of fiber optic that contained a fluorescent dye from her lab. I found a violet laser in the storage closet, and we were able to observe the fluorescence. It made for a pretty cool photo. The green line is the fiber optic fluorescing and the violet line is the path of the laser along the carpet.</p>

            <h3>August 21, 2017</h3>
            <p>The Great American Solar Eclipse happened during my eye doctor appointment, so I set up a telescope viewer in the parking lot and was able to easily view and photograph (a magnified version of) the eclipse. We were even able to see sunspots. </p>

            <h2>DIY Holograms</h2>
            <h3>September 20, 2017</h3>
            <p>This was a quick arts-and-crafts project involving some cut up plastic and a smartphone. I cut four out four isoceles trapezoids from transparent plastic and taped them together into a truncated pyramid. This was placed onto a phone with the narrow end touching the screen. There are videos online designed for this activity, and we pulled one up on the phone. The resulting images appear to float in the space inside the pyramid.</p>

            <h3>January 18, 2017</h3>
            <p>
                In preparation for the annual <a href="http://scioly.mit.edu">MIT Science Olympiad Invitational</a>, I was in the lab preparing reagents for the competitors. This was my first time making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict%27s_reagent">Benedict's Reagent</a> which is a solution that was commonly used to identify reducing sugars before modern analytical equipment like mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, and NMR were developed. Notably, it is able to distinguish between glucose, which is reducing, and sucrose, which is not, despite their very similar structures. The solution is really easy to use: add the sample and heat in a warm water bath. It worked very well and was pretty exciting to see in action.

            <h2>Cabbage Juice Indicator</h2>
            <h3>August 17, 2016</h3>
            <p>
                It's commonly known that red cabbage juice is a good indicator, but this experiment actually worked much better than I anticipated. I separate the leaves on half a red cabbage and boiled them in water. I boiled down the remaining liquid to concentrate it. As a side note, it's best to do this outside since everything will smell like cabbage. It actually did not look like too much was happening initially, and I was concerned that perhaps the dye was being destroyed by heat or boiled away, but using my <a href="../projects/colorimeter/">colorimeter</a>, I was able to confirm that in fact the solution was concentrating.

            <h2>Copper Sulfate Methanol Flame</h2>
            <h3>August 1, 2016</h3>
            <p>
                The normal methanol flame test with copper sulfate. Do not attempt to replicate this without extensive safety precautions and preparations in place. Methanol burns very hot and with a nearly invisible flame under sunlight. The best way to extinguish these flames is to cover the burning liquid, not to throw water on it which could splash flaming methanol everywhere. Also, be sure to use glassware that can withstand the high temperature. I am using a borosilicate petri dish in the picture.

            <h2>Laser Cutting Toast</h2>
            <h3>May 25, 2016</h3>
            <p>
                A laser cutter is essentially a point source of heat on a 2D pen plotter. This makes it useful for engraving and cutting a variety of materials -- including bread. On the last day of high school, we decided to hang around after school ended to try out our idea. Our high school has an Epilog Zing laser, and we loaded it up with some bread. We started out with some initial test cuts and produced some nice croutons.

            <p>
                We used 3% hydrogen peroxide and 10M hydrochloric acid (strongly diluted with water) sold as muriatic acid at the hardware store. Exact quantities and ratios are not critical, but it is worthwhile to run some tests first before trying on your final board. Also, the acidified copper waste (green solution) can either be stored for future use (the \(CuCl_2\) is also a very good etchant!) or disposed of properly by neutralizing with aluminum foil or taking it to a hazardous waste disposal area.
            </p>
            <p>
                The chemistry behind this etchant is fairly interesting. In the initial solution, hydrogen peroxide (\(H_2O_2\)) is the oxidizing agent that will attack the copper in the acidic conditions to produce \(Cu^{2+}\).
                $$Cu(s) + H_2O_2(aq) + 2H^+(aq) \rightarrow Cu^{2+}(aq) + 2H_2O(l)$$
                The green solution is due to the copper(II) chloride that is produced. (In the presence of copper, the hydrogen peroxide also decomposes into water and oxygen which explains the gas bubbles that are formed, but this is not relevant to the etching.)
            </p>
            <p>
                The \(CuCl_2\) that is produced in this reaction is also an oxidizing agent, so the resulting green solution can be reused! It undergoes the following synproportionation redox reation with metallic copper:
                $$Cu(s) + CuCl_2(aq) \rightarrow 2CuCl(aq)$$
                The formation of brown copper(I) chloride indicates that the solution is saturating. To regenerate the green copper(II) solution, just add some more acid and hydrogen peroxide to re-oxidize the copper(I). Thus this solution theoretically produces no waste as long as you intend to keep etching PCBs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The PCB was created using the toner transfer method, and the areas where the toner did not fully transfer were filled in with white-out which we found worked best at preventing unintended etching.

            <p>
                Copper, when heated to red hot, will catalyze the decomposition of acetone. This process produces enough heat to maintain the temperature of the copper and continue the reaction, producing an interesting glowing light show. The video below was produced by heating an approximately quarter inch section of copper pipe suspended on a wire with a propane torch to red hot and lowering it into an Erlenmeyer flask containing a small amount of acetone at the bottom.
