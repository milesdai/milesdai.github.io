[Benedict's Reagent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict%27s_reagent) is an analytical chemical reagent composed of sodium carbonate, sodium citrate, and copper(II) sulfate that tests for the presence of reducing agents.

In particular, it is generally used to determine the presence of a reducing sugars (i.e. a sugar that can behave as a reducing agent). Because its mechanism relies on reducing the copper II ions, it will give a positive result if any sufficiently strong reducing agent is present. In typical use cases, this can include the presence of aldehydes, alpha-hydroxy-ketones, and hemiacetals.

In Science Olympiad, this reagent is typically used to differentiate between glucose and sucrose. As an aldose, glucose has an aldehyde group that is succeptible to oxidation. Sucrose, on the other hand, consists of fructose and glucose joined in such a way that the glycodidic bond prevents the isomerization of the glucose into an aldehyde or the fructose into an alpha-hydroxy-ketone form, giving it a negative test with Benedict's.

## Procedure

In preparation for the annual [MIT Science Olympiad Invitational](https://scioly.mit.edu), I was in the lab preparing reagents for the competitors. The preparation for Benedict's is fairly straightforward. I followed the composition given [here](https://microbiologyinfo.com/benedicts-test-principle-composition-preparation-procedure-and-result-interpretation/), but the exact ratios do not appear to be critical. The quantities for one liter of solution are as follows:

* Sodium carbonate, anhydrous: 100 g
* Sodium citrate: 173 g
* Copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate: 17.3 g

The solution is really easy to use: add the sample and heat in a warm water bath. The presence of a reducing sugar causes the formation of copper (I) oxide, a dark red precipitate. This gives the orange color below.
