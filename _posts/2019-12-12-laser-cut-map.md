My friend and I recently helped out with making a secret santa gift for someone who had indicated an interest in maps. We decided to create a laser engraved map of his hometown -- Seattle.

This turned out to be quite fast using an online service called [Snazzy Maps](https://snazzymaps.com/). Using a template on there called Epilog Laser Reverse, we were able to generate a B/W SVG file that we cleaned up in Illustrator before printing onto 1/8" thick clear acrylic. This was put into a picture frame with a black construction paper background for a nice gift.
