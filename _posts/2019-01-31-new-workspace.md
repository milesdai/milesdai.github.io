I recently acquired some nice electronics test equipment, including a bench multimeter, analog oscilloscope, and lab power supply.

It seemed like a waste for them to just sit in storage, so I requested a second desk in my room, lofted my bed, and set up this lab bench under my bed.

This has been particularly nice because my dorm room is so far from the labs on campus that it's often hard to get access to test equipment when I need it. Also, I found that using public spaces as work benches becomes a problem since I often spend about as much time setting up and cleaning up my projects as I do actually working on them. This setup should solve both problems. So far, it's been working out pretty well, and hopefully, it will get some nice additions soon.
