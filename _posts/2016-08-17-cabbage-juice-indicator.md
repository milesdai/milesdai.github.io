It's commonly known that red cabbage juice is a good indicator, but this experiment actually worked much better than I anticipated.

I separate the leaves on half a red cabbage and boiled them in water. I boiled down the remaining liquid to concentrate it. As a side note, it's best to do this outside since everything will smell like cabbage. It actually did not look like too much was happening initially, and I was concerned that perhaps the dye was being destroyed by heat or boiled away, but using my [colorimeter]({% link _posts/2016-05-30-colorimeter.md %}), I was able to confirm that in fact the solution was concentrating.
