title: DIY Hologram

This was a quick arts-and-crafts project involving some cut up plastic and a smartphone.

I cut four out four isoceles trapezoids from transparent plastic and taped them together into a truncated pyramid. This was placed onto a phone with the narrow end touching the screen. There are videos online designed for this activity, and we pulled one up on the phone. The resulting images appear to float in the space inside the pyramid.
