Methanol burns very hot and with a nearly invisible flame under sunlight. The best way to extinguish these flames is to cover the burning liquid, not to throw water on it which could splash flaming methanol everywhere. Also, be sure to use glassware that can withstand the high temperature. I am using a borosilicate petri dish in the picture.
