A laser cutter is essentially a point source of heat on a 2D plotter. This makes it useful for engraving and cutting a variety of materials -- including bread.

On the last day of high school, we decided to hang around after school ended to try out our idea. Our high school has an Epilog Zing laser, and we loaded it up with some bread. We started out with some initial test cuts and produced some nice croutons.

Because the inital test cuts were promising, we moved on to more ambitious engravings.

Black-and-white images also engrave fantastically. Here are two of our teachers with their faces on toast.
