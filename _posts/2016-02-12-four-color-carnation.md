I got a white carnation from our high school's Valentine's Day celebration, and I thought it would be interesting to try the experiment in which the flower is placed in colored water to try and change the color of its petals.

As an extension, I split the stem into four parts and dipped each into a different colored solution. Here are the results:

<div class="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/carnation/carnation1.jpg" alt="Initial carnation setup" class="three-image-row">
    <img src="/assets/img/carnation/carnation2.jpg" alt="Resulting carnation" class="three-image-row">
</div>
*Carnation setup (left). Results after 4 days (right).*
