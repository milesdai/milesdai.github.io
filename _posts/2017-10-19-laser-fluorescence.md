One of the students in our dorm brought back a piece of fiber optic that contained a fluorescent dye from her lab. I found a violet laser in the storage closet, and we were able to observe the fluorescence. It made for a pretty cool photo. The green line is the fiber optic fluorescing, and the violet line is the path of the laser along the carpet.

The choice of a violet laser was not just aesthetic. The fluorescence phenomenon is the emission of light by a material that has absorbed electromagnetic radiation. Upon absorbtion of the energy, molecules exhibiting fluorescence enter an excited, high-energy state. As they relax to lower energy states, they will release some of the absorbed energy by emitting photons. However, since energy can also be released via other means, the emitted photon will always be of lower energy (i.e. longer wavelength). Since the fiber optic was known to fluoresce green, it is necessary to excite it with light of a higher energy (i.e. shorter wavelenght). Thus, neither the more common red nor green lasers would suffice. The purple laser, with a shorter wavelength, is able to excite the fluorescent dye.
